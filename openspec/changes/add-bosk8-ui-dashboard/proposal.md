## Why
Supply chain stakeholders need a production-ready UI to monitor fulfillment speed, on-time rate, and shipped volume from Snowflake/dbt models. Today, the repo ships data models and Looker guidance but no reusable UI system. We will introduce a minimal, accessible Bosk8-branded UI that strictly adheres to `style.md` for tokens, components, and interactions.

## What Changes
- Add Bosk8 UI shell (headerless hero, card grid, content container) using tokens from `style.md`.
- Add real-time KPI dashboard screens bound to dbt models: `kpi_daily_fulfillment`, `fct_orders`, `dim_warehouse`.
- Add reusable interactive component library (cards, KPIs, table, tooltip, FAQ/accordion, link/action patterns) strictly mapped to `style.md` tokens.
- Define navigation and routing model for dashboard, warehouse detail, and data quality views.
- Provide accessibility checklist and WCAG 2.2 AA guidance per tokens.
- Provide Style Compliance Matrix and Style Decisions Log (assumptions/derivations only from `style.md`).
- Provide dev handoff artifacts: CSS variables, example HTML/CSS/React snippets, redlines, and acceptance criteria.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `ui-shell`, `kpi-dashboard`, `components-library`, `routing`, `accessibility`.
- Affected code/docs: adds UI spec artifacts only; no dbt SQL changes required. Optional lightweight API adapter for Snowflake/Looker connections described in design.

## Constraints
- Single source of truth for visuals/interaction is `style.md`. No new tokens may be invented; any missing items must be derived and logged.
- Prefer read-only dashboard first; write operations are out of scope.
- Keep implementation minimal and dependency-light.

## Personas
- Operations Manager: needs daily overview and trends.
- Warehouse Lead: needs per-warehouse performance and breakdowns.
- Data Analyst: needs drill-down, export, and data freshness context.

## Goals
- Fast, legible, dark minimal mono interface using tokens from `style.md`.
- Clear KPI cards, time series, and warehouse breakdown table.
- Keyboard-accessible interactions and visible focus states.

## Non-Goals
- Complex theming beyond dark baseline in `style.md`.
- Writebacks (annotations, targets) or admin workflows.

## Open Risks
- Connector choice (direct Snowflake vs. Looker embed) can affect latency and auth.
- Data freshness variability; surface via exposures and freshness metadata.
