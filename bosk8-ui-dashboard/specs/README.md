---

### 7. Accessibility Checklist
**File:** `accessibility-checklist.md`  
**Purpose:** WCAG 2.2 AA compliance checklist with validation and testing recommendations.

**Key Contents:**
- Perceivable (1.1-1.5): Text alternatives, time-based media, adaptable, distinguishable, audio control
- Operable (2.1-2.5): Keyboard accessible, enough time, seizures, navigable, input modalities
- Understandable (3.1-3.3): Readable, predictable, input assistance
- Robust (4.1-4.2): Compatible, status messages
- Implementation checklist
- Testing recommendations (automated and manual)
- Known issues and recommendations (contrast issues)

---

### 8. Style Compliance Matrix
**File:** `style-compliance-matrix.md`  
**Purpose:** Exact `style.md` token usage for each screen and component.

**Key Contents:**
- Screen-level token mapping (dashboard, warehouse detail, data quality, filters)
- Component-level token mapping (all 7 components)
- Universal states token mapping (loading, error, focus)
- Summary of derived tokens (11 derived tokens documented)
- All tokens cross-referenced to `style.md` paths

---

### 9. Style Decisions Log
**File:** `style-decisions-log.md`  
**Purpose:** Complete log of assumptions, derivations, conflicts, and resolutions.

**Key Contents:**
- 10 assumptions documented
- 11 derived tokens with derivation logic and rationale
- 3 conflicts resolved in favor of `style.md`
- 5 open questions deferred to implementation
- Style token usage summary (direct from `style.md` vs. derived)
- Validation checklist

---

### 10. Developer Handoff Artifacts
**File:** `dev-handoff.md`  
**Purpose:** Implementation-ready tokens, CSS, HTML/CSS/React snippets, and acceptance criteria.

**Key Contents:**
- Complete token map (CSS variables)
- Global resets and base styles
- Component CSS snippets (all components)
- HTML snippets (dashboard, KPI cards, table, states)
- React component examples (KPIStat, DataTable)
- Spacing/redlines
- Acceptance checklist (style compliance, components, screens, accessibility, motion, data contracts, navigation, browser testing)

## Quick Start for Developers

1. **Read First**: `executive-summary.md` for high-level context
2. **Design Tokens**: See `dev-handoff.md` for complete CSS token map
3. **Components**: See `components-library-detailed.md` for component specs
4. **Screens**: See `screen-specs.md` for screen wireframes and layouts
5. **Data Contracts**: See `function-to-ui-mapping.md` for API contracts
6. **Accessibility**: See `accessibility-checklist.md` for WCAG compliance
7. **Style Reference**: See `style.md` (root level) for single source of truth

---

## Style Compliance

### Rules
1. **Do not invent** new tokens, named styles, or patterns not present in `style.md`
2. If a needed token/pattern is missing, **derive it from existing tokens** using rules in `style.md`, create a clear derivation entry, and record it in the Style Decisions Log
3. If a conflict arises between pragmatic needs and `style.md`, **resolve in favor of `style.md`** and record the conflict + resolution in the Style Decisions Log
4. Always reference exact `style.md` token names/paths in specs

### Token Validation
- All tokens used must be either:
  - Directly from `style.md` (documented in Style Compliance Matrix)
  - Derived from `style.md` tokens (documented in Style Decisions Log)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All screens use tokens from `style.md` only
- [x] All derived tokens logged in Style Decisions Log
- [x] No new tokens invented without derivation
